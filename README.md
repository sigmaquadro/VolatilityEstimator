## Welcome to Volatility Estimator Project

Here we share the Python code that implements a version of the Order Statistics Volatility Estimator that we developed to detect the Brownian motion part of a time series and the corresponding jump component.
We presented the results of our work at Global Derivatives 2017 conference and we will soon share on arXiv the related paper.
This first implementation is very simple and based on functions.

#Update
We published our paper on arXiv. Please find it at
